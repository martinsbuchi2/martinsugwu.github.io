# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I'm an experienced Remote Sensing, GIS, and full-stack software developer, with a proven track record of leveraging Copernicus data and EO*GI services to support informed decision-making. I am eager to further my career through a fully funded scholarship, aiming to deepen my expertise in geospatial technology and Earth observation while focusing on applying programming tools to enhance analytical processes and operational efficiency.
