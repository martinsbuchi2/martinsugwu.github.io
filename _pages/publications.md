## Python
  
In my role, my Python tech stack includes GeoPandas, Shapely, Rasterio, and GDAL for spatial data processing, along with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow for predictive analytics. Tools like VS Code (Interactive Window), Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda aid in experimentation, while SQLAlchemy manages spatial databases. With Matplotlib and Folium for visualizations, I deliver clear, actionable insights for the energy sector and beyond. <br />

## JavaScript

As for JavaScript, I focuse on web-based geospatial visualization and data interaction; Leaflet and Mapbox GL for interactive mapping, D3.js for complex data visualizations, and Turf.js for spatial analysis directly in the browser. For front-end frameworks, React pairs well with these libraries to create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces for data insights. Additionally, Node.js supports backend processing for data handling and API integration, while libraries like Axios streamline data fetching. This tech stack enables me to deliver accessible, interactive geospatial solutions that communicate complex spatial data and tools effectively for relevant stakeholders.

## AI Career Essentials

AI-driven approach streamlines processes, improves operational efficiency, and ensures optimized workplace performance through actionable intelligence. other than leveraging Python libraries for automations and building machine learning models, tools like NLP models (using libraries like spaCy or Hugging Face) help automate text-based data analysis for report generation and communication.
