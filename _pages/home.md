I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Dr. Trevor Keenan. My research broadly focuses on the monitoring and understanding of carbon and vegetation dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems. I am interested in the synegestic usage of of data-driven and process-based knowledge to understand ecosystem-climate interactions through observational data from remote sensing and sensor networks. I work on both natural and managed ecosystems with a overarching goal of building mechanistic understandings of ecosystem processes across spatial scales. My past work has mainly focused on devising novel frameworks to quantify Leaf Area Index and crop yields at high spatial resolutions over large regions. Currently, I am exploring emerging data-drive appraoches to estimate global photosynthesis.
