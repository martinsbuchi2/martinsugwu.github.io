I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley working with Dr. Trevor Keenan. My research broadly focuses on the monitoring and understanding of carbon and vegetation dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems. I combine machine learning and process-based modeling with remote sensing and eddy covariance data to quantify ecosystem responses to a changing climate. My interests span both natural and managed ecosystems with the overarching goal of building mechanistic understandings of climate-vegetation interactions across spatial scales.
