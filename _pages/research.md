    title: "Effect of land use land cover changes on the rate of soil erosion in the Otamiri Watershed, Southern Nigeria"
    excerpt: >
        This study examines the **impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on soil erosion rates within the Otamiri watershed** spanning across **Owerri to Rivers States, Southern, Nigeria**. Using the **Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with remote sensing and GIS technologies**, the research tracks LULC changes between **1996** and **2016**. The findings indicate significant **deforestation and land conversion**, leading to increased **soil erosion**. This necessitates the **implementation of sustainable land management practices** to mitigate further degradation. <br />

    title: "GIS Approach to Site Suitability for Large-Scale Solar Farms in Osun East District, Nigeria"
    excerpt: >
        This study focuses on identifying **optimal sites for large-scale solar farms** within the **Osun East District**, Nigeria. It employs **GIS and Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP)** to perform suitability analysis, identifying the most favorable locations based on **environmental, social, and technical criteria**. The study reveals that approximately **2.6%** of the total area is highly suitable, potentially generating **3,470 MW** of electricity, while moderately suitable areas could yield an additional **28,000 MW**. These findings highlight the significant renewable energy potential in Osun East.. <br />

    title: "Achievements at the REA during my Time as TA to Executive Director, Playing Key Role in Project Planning"
    excerpt: >
        Over the years, I have actively contributed to various geospatial projects demonstrating my expertise. Notably, while working as a **Geodata Analyst at INTEGRATION Consulting**, I contributed to the **Nigeria Energy Support Program (NESP)**, which is co-funded by the **EU** and **German BMZ**. In this role, I managed a nationwide data pipeline and played a key part in developing the **[Nigeria SE4ALL web map version 3.0](https://nigeriase4all.gov.ng/)** using React JS, MapLibre JS, and PostGIS, which visualized over 1,000,000 points of interest (POIs). My responsibilities included performing data quality checks, automating the processing of socio-economic data, and developing XLSForms with complex logic to ensure data quality during field surveys across 700+ off-grid settlements, all deployed via a custom Kobo server. Additionally, I set up an OpenStreetMap (OSM) wiki, wrote Python scripts for semi-automated data uploads, and created a QGIS plugin to automate Atlas generation, thereby streamlining the preparation of tools for nationwide electrification data collection. <br />  <br />  Since joining the **REA** as a **Technical Assistant on Geodata Analysis**, My work has resulted in significant cost savings for Nigeriaâ€™s energy sector, particularly by leveraging satellite remote sensing, GIS, AI and machine learning to implement optimized, least-cost geospatial solutions for electrification of underserved and unserved communities. This support is key in the deployment of 56 solar mini-grids (14 MW), 6 EV charging stations, 497,000 solar home systems, and 35,000 solar streetlights, extending the national grid by 2,000 km and benefiting 1.5 million people. I also lead **capacity-building initiatives** through **data clinics, help desks, and training sessions**, guiding relevant stakeholders in the use of **ArcGIS, QGIS, VIDA, and other geospatial tools needed for electrification projects**. So, my work supports **energy access, socio-economic growth**, and **agricultural productivity**, demonstrating my commitment to leveraging **geospatial technologies** for **sustainable development**. <br />
