    title: "The Advantage Series"
    excerpt: >
        My participation in the [YALI](https://yaliwestafrica.net/rlc/) (17-week leadership training) not only prepared me for life after school but also equipped me with the necessary knowledge to successfully co-convene [The Advantage Group](https.//facebook.com/tag.com.ng), an organization formed with the vision of giving students and graduates a competitive edge that distinguishes them globally. Each year, we organize inspiring outreaches, conferences and workshops designed to equip students and graduates with essential knowledge and skills in various areas, including academics, entrepreneurship, renewable energy, the environment, leadership, and career development. The first edition, TAGâ€™17, was organized by a team of ten under my direction and attracted approximately 500 participants. To date, we have built a network of over 3,000 Nigerian students. <br />

    title: "2017 World Environment Day Celebration at FUTO"
    excerpt: >
      Building on the success of TAG 17, my team took on the responsibility of organizing the World Environment Day celebration. During the event, we led several community service initiatives, including tree-planting exercise within the FUTO environment, clean-up campaign in parks, drainages, and the Otamiri River within the school environment. We also arranged panel discussions with experts on relevant topics on climate change and environmental conservation. <br />

    title: "GIS Day Conference at the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA)"
    excerpt: >
      Like the annual World Environment Day celebration, GIS Day also provides me with valuable opportunities to involve in community services, usually in the form of volunteering. Each year, it brings unique chances to grow, learn, and evolve. Notably, the 2018 edition allowed me to participate in mapping projects that supported the well-being of the Kuje community in Abuja. I also co-hosted an Introductory GIS Workshop for beginners and joined a team of GIS experts on a visit to the University of Abuja, where we presented on various GIS-related topics. <br />
