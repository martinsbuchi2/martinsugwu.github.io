    title: "Effect of land use land cover changes on the rate of soil erosion in the Otamiri Watershed, Southern Nigeria"
    excerpt: >
        This study examines the **impact of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on soil erosion rates within the Otamiri watershed** spanning across **Owerri to Rivers States, Southern, Nigeria**. Using the **Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) integrated with remote sensing and GIS technologies**, the research tracks LULC changes between **1996** and **2016**. The findings indicate significant **deforestation and land conversion**, leading to increased **soil erosion**. This necessitates the **implementation of sustainable land management practices** to mitigate further degradation. <br />

    title: "GIS Approach to Site Suitability for Large-Scale Solar Farms in Osun East District, Nigeria"
    excerpt: >
        This study focuses on identifying **optimal sites for large-scale solar farms** within the **Osun East District**, Nigeria. It employs **GIS and Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP)** to perform suitability analysis, identifying the most favorable locations based on **environmental, social, and technical criteria**. The study reveals that approximately **2.6%** of the total area is highly suitable, potentially generating **3,470 MW** of electricity, while moderately suitable areas could yield an additional **28,000 MW**. These findings highlight the significant renewable energy potential in Osun East.. <br />

    title: "Achievements at the REA during my Time as TA to Executive Director, Playing Key Role in Project Planning"
    excerpt: >
        My work has resulted in significant cost savings for Nigeria's energy sector, particularly by leveraging satellite remote sensing, GIS, AI and machine learning to implement optimized, least-cost geospatial solutions for electrification of underserved and unserved communities. Since joining the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) as a Technical Advisor on Geodata Analysis, my work has been supported by various EO technologies across multiple areas, including the planning, monitoring, and evaluation (M&E) of various renewable energy projects. This support is key in the deployment of 56 solar mini-grids (14 MW), 6 EV charging stations, 497,000 solar home systems, and 35,000 solar streetlights, extending the national grid by 2,000 km and benefiting 1.5 million people. <br />
