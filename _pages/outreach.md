    title: "The Advantage Series"
    excerpt: >
        My participation in the **YALI** (12-week leadership training) not only prepared me for life after school but also equipped me with the necessary knowledge to successfully co-convene **[The Advantage Group](https.//facebook.com/tag.com.ng)**, an organization formed with the vision of giving students and graduates a competitive edge that distinguishes them globally. Each year, we organize inspiring **outreaches, conferences and workshops** designed to equip students and graduates with essential knowledge and skills in various areas, including **academics, entrepreneurship, renewable energy, the environment, leadership, and career development**. The first edition, **TAG’17**, was organized by a team of ten under my direction and attracted approximately **500 participants**. To date, we have built a network of over **3,000 Nigerian students**. <br />

    title: "2017 World Environment Day Celebration at FUTO"
    excerpt: >
        Building on the success of **TAG 17**, my team took on the responsibility of organizing the **World Environment Day** celebration. During the event, we led several community service initiatives, including **tree-planting exercise** within the FUTO environment, **clean-up campaign** in parks, drainages, and the Otamiri River within the school environment. We also arranged **panel discussions** with experts on relevant topics on **climate change and environmental conservation**. <br />

    title: "GIS Day Conference at the National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA)"
    excerpt: >
        Like the annual **World Environment Day** celebration, **GIS Day** also provides me with valuable opportunities to involve in **community services**, usually in the form of **volunteering**. Each year, it brings unique chances to grow, learn, and evolve. Notably, the **2018 edition** allowed me to participate in **mapping projects** that supported the well-being of the **Kuje community in Abuja**. I also co-hosted an **Introductory GIS Workshop** for beginners and joined a team of GIS experts on a visit to the **University of Abuja**, where we presented on various GIS-related topics. <br />
