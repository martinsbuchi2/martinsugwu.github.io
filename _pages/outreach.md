    title: "The Advantage Series"
    excerpt: >
        My participation in the **YALI** (12-week leadership training) not only prepared me for life after school but also equipped me with the necessary knowledge to successfully co-convene **[The Advantage Group](https.//facebook.com/tag.com.ng)**, an organization formed with the vision of giving students and graduates a competitive edge that distinguishes them globally. Each year, we organize inspiring **outreaches, conferences and workshops** designed to equip students and graduates with essential knowledge and skills in various areas, including **academics, entrepreneurship, renewable energy, the environment, leadership, and career development**. The first edition, **TAG’17**, was organized by a team of ten under my direction and attracted approximately **500 participants**. To date, we have built a network of over **3,000 Nigerian students**. <br />

    title: "GIS Approach to Site Suitability for Large-Scale Solar Farms in Osun East District, Nigeria"
    excerpt: >
        This study focuses on identifying **optimal sites for large-scale solar farms** within the **Osun East District**, Nigeria. It employs **GIS and Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP)** to perform suitability analysis, identifying the most favorable locations based on **environmental, social, and technical criteria**. The study reveals that approximately **2.6%** of the total area is highly suitable, potentially generating **3,470 MW** of electricity, while moderately suitable areas could yield an additional **28,000 MW**. These findings highlight the significant renewable energy potential in Osun East.. <br />

    title: "Achievements at the REA during my Time as TA to Executive Director, Playing Key Role in Project Planning"
    excerpt: >
        My work has resulted in significant cost savings for Nigeria's energy sector, particularly by leveraging satellite remote sensing, GIS, AI and machine learning to implement optimized, least-cost geospatial solutions for electrification of underserved and unserved communities. Since joining the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) as a Technical Advisor on Geodata Analysis, my work has been supported by various EO technologies across multiple areas, including the planning, monitoring, and evaluation (M&E) of various renewable energy projects. This support is key in the deployment of 56 solar mini-grids (14 MW), 6 EV charging stations, 497,000 solar home systems, and 35,000 solar streetlights, extending the national grid by 2,000 km and benefiting 1.5 million people. <br />
