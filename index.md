I’m experienced Remote Sensing, GIS, and full-stack software developer, with a proven track record of leveraging Copernicus data and EO*GI services to support informed decision-making. 

I am eager to further my career through a fully funded scholarship, aiming to deepen my expertise in geospatial technology and Earth observation while focusing on applying programming tools to enhance analytical processes and operational efficiency. 

### Conferences Attended & Involvements in SDG 7 & 13 Related Activities

 **`2024:`**

* **November - December:** Excited to enroll for **Cloud Computing and algorithms for EO analyses**.

* **September:** Participated in the **2024 Environmental Conference** tagged: *Harmony in Sustainability, Nurturing Environmental Visionaries*.
* **June:** Participated and Successfully Completed the **"Uncertainty Analysis for Energy System Studies"** course, held by **EIT HEI Initiative** and Organized by the **Technical University of Denmark**.
* **June:** The **United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)** recognition for joining the **#GenerationRestoration** movement and making **World Environment Day 2024** a huge success.

**`2023:`**

* **December:** Completed the 13-week **Global Youth Climate Training**, through the **Global Youth Coalition**
* **November:** Completed the **VIDA** software training on **Nigeria Energy Geospatial Platform** for *Distributed Access to Renewable Energy Scale-up (DARES)*.
* **November:** NASRDA 2023 **GIS Day Celebration**, Theme: *GIS for Executives*
* **October:** Joined the Sixth Edition of **The Social Town Talk Series** - **International Carbon Conference** supported by **Neem Software**.
* **September:** Joined 8th edition of **International Youth Conference (IYC)** held in hybrid format in **New York City, USA**. under the theme *"Empowering Youth to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals"* in partnership with **UN-Habitat and Global Civil Society Organizations**.





<!-- * **Januray 2024:** Our OpenET benchmark paper, where I'm a co-author, is published at [Nature Water](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44221-023-00181-7), offering rigorous assesmsnet of satellite-derived evapotranspiration for resources management.
* **December 2023:** For the second year in a row, hosted our innovative session on "Emerging Machine Learning Approaches for Process Understanding in Ecosystem Sciences" at AGU.
* **December 2023:** Presented our CEDAR-GPP dataset at the AGU, offering vital spatiotemporal estimates of GPP that incorporates the CO2 fertilization effect.
* **October 2023:** Our preprint, “CEDAR-GPP: Spatiotemporally Upscaled Estimates of Gross Primary Productivity Incorporating CO2 Fertilization,” is now under discussion at _[Earth System Science Data](https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2023-337/)_.
* **September 2023:** Excited to announce our preprint, “Using Automated Machine Learning for the Upscaling of Gross Primary Productivity,” is currently under discussion at _[Biogeosciences](https://bg.copernicus.org/preprints/bg-2023-141/)_.
* **August 2023:** Presented our recent findings on atmospheric CO2 impacts on global photosynthesis at the _ESA Annual Meeting_ in Portland, Oregon.
* **July 2023:** Delivered a presentation on our work and perspectives on high-resolution satellite LAI data products at _IGARSS 2023_ in Pasadena, CA.
* **June 2023:** A team of master's students under my guidance presented our collaborative work, _"Upscaling Global Hourly GPP with Temporal Fusion Transformer,"_ at the CVPR MultiEarth 2023 Workshop. [paper](link) -->
